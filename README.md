## Introduction

Based on Belpaeme et al. 2018, we propose an updated and ovel analysis of the litterature of social robots for leanring. 
Thie repo contains the code used to generate the figures for the paper "Research Trends in Social Robots for Learning" as well as the annotated dataset used for the analysis. 


## Usage
